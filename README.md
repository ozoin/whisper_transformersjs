**Real-time Transcription:** Transcribe spoken words into text in real-time, providing users with accurate and instant written representations of audio content.

**Translation Capabilities:** Seamlessly translate transcribed text into various languages, enabling users to understand and communicate across language barriers.

**Web Worker Optimization:** Harness the power of web workers to distribute machine learning model computations, ensuring smooth performance and responsiveness without overloading the main thread.

**Transformers.js Integration:** Incorporate the Transformers.js library to easily manage and deploy machine learning models for transcription and translation tasks.
